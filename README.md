The webbrowser function lets it access the browser and it open tabs infinitly while the kill all program tries to 
close the tabs. The tabs open 2 times faster than the tabs closing so you cant even close the browser and the infinite 
loop crashes your goddamn pc or the pc freezes and blue screen comes. Please dont try to use it on anyone's pc other 
than you and your enemy
